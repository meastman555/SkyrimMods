# SkyrimMods
Collection of .esp files that can be downloaded and included within the files for Skyrim. Custom mods that are of my own creation, made using Bethesda's public Creation Kit engine, and by manipulating the master files for Skyrim. I did everything in-engine, without the use of adding my own Papyrus scripts.
